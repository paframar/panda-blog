<br><br>
#### Notes:
**#1** App can be access using users from the API (email + and any password) or _new registered users_ (email + password). <br>
**#2** Posts created by _new registered users_ that are updated in local storage, but it's totally normal to give an err from API, because the API that fakes the PUT method, doesn't recognize the new created users' id as valid. <br>

#### Unit Testing

1. To run

   ```
   yarn test
   ```
**IMPORTANT!** After installing Cypress react-scripts started having conflicts with Jest and Test run started to fail. <br> I tried to debug it, did great research on it, but couldn't fix it. <br><br>
Nevertheless, you can run and see passing unit tests using on-progress-work branch: `CP-6_unit-tests`. <br> This branch is available to be restored in the following PR:
